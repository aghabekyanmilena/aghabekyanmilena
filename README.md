## Hey everyone, I'm Milena :)

🎓 I’m a 3rd-year Physics student specializing in Data Mining in Physics and Artificial Intelligence.

🏫 I’m part of the TUMOLabs Guided-Self-Learning program, where I’m diving deeper into Python and Machine Learning.
Also I passed selection pool in 42 Yerevan and now I'm studying there as well.

💻 I have a strong passion for AI engineering and programming.

🚀 My current focus is on:
Optimizing machine learning models and learning more about Neural networks.
Master programming and AI methods to use them in science.

Learning C/C++ to enhance my career in physics and artificial intelligence, with a focus on computational simulations and high-performance computing.

🔭 I love exploring the intersection of AI, physics, and data science, and I’m always eager to learn new technologies and solve challenging problems.
